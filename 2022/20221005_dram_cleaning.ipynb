    "After exploration, one annoying pattern has emerged. When we have one hyphen, such as `26 Infidel Belgian IPA - Selkirk Abbey`, the pattern seems to be `beer - brewery`. When we have three hyphens, it seems that often brewer comes first. For instance, `Z Mountains Walking - Sweets - Fruited Berlinerweisse 16oz can` and `Ommegang - Rare Vos Belgian Style Amber Ale  - 6.5% ABV 20 IBU`. \n",

For the record, the larger cell that creates `item_translation` is where I started my work and then I added this other stuff."
